The First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm

I thought starting the blog this way would be funny. It's my first blog, and I may make a lot of mistakes, so please ignore them. I frankly don't even expect anyone will find and read it.

So, starting with why I plan to write this blog. I have thought of doing it for quite some time but chickened out, nonetheless. Today, I got all charged up and decided to do it anyway.

![oh no,anyway oh no, anyway](https://content.imageresizer.com/images/memes/Oh-No-Anyway-meme-5.jpg)

The main idea I had was to redo my portfolio website, and I was thinking of having a markdown-based blog on it. I talked to my friend, and he said, "Why don't you do it using Hashnode?" So, here I am. I am now thinking of setting up GitHub Actions, which would pick my Hashnode blogs and add the markdown version of them to my portfolio website. I'm not sure how I am going to do it, but let's see if it works. ChatGPT and Claude are optimistic that it will work.

Anyway, peace out. I hope this wasn't as boring a read as you might have expected when starting. I plan on having one article per week, hopefully. I only get Saturdays and Sundays free. It will either be some technical stuff, some shitposting, or some random things I come across.

To anyone who reads this, I will update once the personal website and pipeline setup is done. Let's see how it goes.

> Side Note: I write in a pretty messy way, so if you see no grammatical errors, it's because of Hashnode AI.
